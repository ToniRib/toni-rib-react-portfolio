          Since delving into web development in early 2015, I’ve completed Udacity’s Front End Web Development online nanodegree and the back end development program at the Turing School for Software & Design. I worked for 5 months at Travelers Haven in Glendale, CO and am now a Software Engineer at GoSpotCheck in downtown Denver.
